### Context : 
 The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two given positive integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both given integers. Write a program that (a) takes as input two positive integers A and B, (b) passes these two integers to a function, (c) the function computes the LCM and sends the computed result back to the main function, and (d) finally prints the result in the main function. 
Input Format
Single line containing two positive integers A and B
Output Format
Single line containing the LCM of A and B
Sample input:
15 20
Sample output:
60
Note: 
Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:
    cout << "Enter a number:", 
    cout << "The computed answer is", etc. 
In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. 
You just have to print the value of LCM.

 The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two given positive integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both given integers. Write a program that (a) takes as input two positive integers A and B, (b) passes these two integers to a function, (c) the function computes the LCM and sends the computed result back to the main function, and (d) finally prints the result in the main function. 
Input Format
Single line containing two positive integers A and B
Output Format
Single line containing the LCM of A and B

 The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two given positive integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both given integers. Write a program that (a) takes as input two positive integers A and B, (b) passes these two integers to a function, (c) the function computes the LCM and sends the computed result back to the main function, and (d) finally prints the result in the main function. 
Input Format
Single line containing two positive integers A and B
Output Format
Single line containing the LCM of A and B

 The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two given positive integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both given integers. Write a program that (a) takes as input two positive integers A and B, (b) passes these two integers to a function, (c) the function computes the LCM and sends the computed result back to the main function, and (d) finally prints the result in the main function. 
Input Format
Single line containing two positive integers A and B
Output Format
Single line containing the LCM of A and B

 The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two given positive integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both given integers. Write a program that (a) takes as input two positive integers A and B, (b) passes these two integers to a function, (c) the function computes the LCM and sends the computed result back to the main function, and (d) finally prints the result in the main function. 
Input Format
Single line containing two positive integers A and B
Output Format
Single line containing the LCM of A and B

 The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two given positive integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both given integers. Write a program that (a) takes as input two positive integers A and B, (b) passes these two integers to a function, (c) the function computes the LCM and sends the computed result back to the main function, and (d) finally prints the result in the main function. 
Input Format
Single line containing two positive integers A and B
Output Format
Single line containing the LCM of A and B

 The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two given positive integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both given integers. Write a program that (a) takes as input two positive integers A and B, (b) passes these two integers to a function, (c) the function computes the LCM and sends the computed result back to the main function, and (d) finally prints the result in the main function. 
Input Format
Single line containing two positive integers A and B
Output Format
Single line containing the LCM of A and B
